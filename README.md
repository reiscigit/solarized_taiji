Solarized Taiji
===============

A theme for Firefox, based on [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) color palette by [Ethan Schoonover](https://ethanschoonover.com/).

Solarized is a beautiful and eye-friendly color palette for user interface. Taiji (太極 in Chinese) is a philosophy about the united world mixed with yin and yan (陰陽). This theme tried to present good balance and contrast of different colors.
